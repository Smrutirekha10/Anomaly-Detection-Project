Anomaly Detection in Smartphone Datasets

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing anomaly detection techniques on smartphone datasets collected from densely populated environments. By leveraging statistical and machine learning methods, we aim to develop a robust model capable of differentiating between normal and anomalous behavior in smartphone usage.

🎯 Key Objectives

Identify and detect anomalies in smartphone activity data.

Enhance safety and security through anomaly detection.

Improve our understanding of crowd movement dynamics.

🔍 Understanding Anomalous Behavior

Anomalous behavior refers to deviations from expected patterns in a dataset. In a time-series dataset, outliers often represent anomalies. Examples include:

Normal Behavior: A person walking at a regular pace in an open space.

Anomalous Behavior: The same person walking significantly slower in a densely crowded area.

Detecting these behavioral shifts enables improved situational awareness and risk mitigation strategies.
