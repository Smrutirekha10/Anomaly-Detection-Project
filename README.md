Overview

This project explores the application of anomaly detection techniques to smartphone datasets in densely populated environments. By leveraging both statistical and machine learning methods, we aim to develop a robust model capable of distinguishing between typical and unusual behavior patterns in smartphone usage.

Objectives

Detect suspicious activities using smartphone data.

Identify potential risks in densely populated areas.

Enhance the understanding of crowd dynamics through anomaly detection.

Understanding Anomalous Behavior

Anomalous behavior is characterized by deviations from expected patterns in a dataset. In a time-series dataset, outliers typically signify anomalies. For instance:

Non-Anomalous Behavior: A person walking freely in an open space.

Anomalous Behavior: The same person walking unusually slowly in a crowded environment.

By identifying such behavioral shifts, this model can contribute to improved safety measures and insights into human movement patterns.

Methodology
